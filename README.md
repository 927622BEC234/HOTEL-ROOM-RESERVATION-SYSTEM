# 🏨 Hotel Room Reservation System

## 📘 Overview
The **Hotel Room Reservation System** is a simple Java-based project designed to automate hotel booking and room management processes. It allows users to:
- Create and manage customer details  
- Book rooms and generate reservations  
- Check room availability  
- Display booking information  

This project demonstrates **object-oriented programming concepts** in Java such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and enums.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The `Customer` class stores customer details and validates the email format.  
2. The `Room` and `FreeRoom` classes define room details and pricing.  
3. The `Reservation` class handles booking details such as room, customer, and stay duration.  
4. The `Tester` class runs the system to demonstrate reservation creation and room availability checking.

Would you like me to make it more **academic-style (for mini-project submission)** or **professional-style (for GitHub portfolio)**?
